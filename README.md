# Contacts App

This is a really simple application made in VueJS where you have a list of contacts, with a favourite section and other contacts section.
You can make a contact favourite if you like, but it won't store the information.

## Project setup
First of all, start by installing the dependencies...
```
npm install
```
Run the following command to start a development server and test the app in development mode.
```
npm run serve
```

TODO - Serve the application in production mode.
